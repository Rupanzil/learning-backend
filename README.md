## Learning Express.js

Express.js is a javascript library used to create servers easily.
Following this amazing tutorial by [Kyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SccSCuHhOw0)

### Steps followed to create a simple server file which responds from the server

1. Install dependencies
   `npm i express ejs`
2. Create .gitignore to ignore the files which we don't need on github.
3. Install nodemon so that we don't need to close and open the server again and again.
4. Write the code in the server.js
5. run server.js file
6. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and then you can see your message which you sent using `res.send()`
